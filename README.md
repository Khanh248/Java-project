# mergeGame
The goal is to manage falling squares, merge them, and score points. The game features a 
grid where squares of varying sizes fall from the top and can be moved left or right by the 
player. When two squares of the same size and either adjacent or stacked on top of each 
other, they merge into a larger square, and the player earns points.
